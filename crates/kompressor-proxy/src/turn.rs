//! Reading a completed assistant turn, and writing the next request from it.
//!
//! Three families, three spellings of the same two facts: what the model asked
//! for, and how to tell it what it got. Everything family-specific about the
//! non-streaming retrieve loop is in this module, so the loop itself reads the
//! same for all three.
//!
//! Mixed turns return the client's tool calls, with the proxy's private calls
//! removed, matching the streamed handover policy.
//!
//! What that costs, stated so it is a decision rather than a surprise: the
//! model's retrieve call is dropped **unanswered**. It asked for an elided
//! fragment and gets no result and no refusal. The alternative is worse —
//! answering our call means putting a tool result into a conversation the
//! client is also being handed, for a call the client never saw, and the
//! provider rejects the next request for a result it has no call for. The
//! marker and its handle are still in the context, so the model can ask again
//! on a later turn; a model that *always* pairs a retrieve with another tool
//! call never gets one, which is a capability limit rather than a loop, since
//! the client's own call still makes progress each turn.
