//! Recording the bodies of a live session, for the one question summary
//! statistics cannot answer.
//!
//! The provider's cached prefix has been seen to shrink mid-conversation across
//! eighteen benchmark runs (DESIGN §20, open question 8), and five candidate
//! causes have been cleared by experiment without finding the real one. Every
//! one of those experiments worked from aggregates — token counts, handle
//! counts, message counts — and the remaining question is not answerable from
//! any of them: *which byte changed*. A hermetic reproduction was built and
//! cleared two suspects, but it has never reproduced the break itself, so the
//! fixtures differ from live traffic in some way that is itself unidentified.
//!
//! So this records what actually crosses the wire. Both directions, because the
//! discriminator is whether a changed byte came from the agent or from this
//! proxy: if turn N+1's *incoming* body already differs from turn N's at the
//! position the cache fell back to, the agent rewrote its own history and
//! nothing here is at fault.
//!
//! Off unless `KOMPRESSOR_BODY_CAPTURE` names a file, and best-effort when on —
//! a diagnostic that can break the session it is observing is worse than no
//! diagnostic. Bodies are written whole and uncompressed: a run is roughly
//! seventy requests of 15–80 KB each way, so a few megabytes, and truncating
//! them would throw away the only thing the file is for.
//!
//! Correlate with `proxy_requests` on `request_id` for the conversation, the
//! cache reads and the turn ordering; this file deliberately records none of
//! them rather than deriving a second copy that could disagree.
