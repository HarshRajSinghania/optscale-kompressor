"""Build a conversation corpus from a run's captured request bodies.

    scripts/bench/extract-conversations.py --from <run-dir>... --out fixtures/conversations.jsonl.gz

# Why the bodies and not the ref store

`kompressor bench extract` reads each run's `kompressor-refs.db`, which holds
only content that became a *handle*. That is the right source for the payload
corpus and the wrong one here: a cross-turn fold replaces a repeat with a
back-reference and usually mints nothing, so the compressor this corpus exists
to measure is largely absent from that store by construction. It is also why
`cross_turn` has had no corpus coverage while being one of the two largest real
compressors.

`kompressor-bodies.jsonl` holds whole request bodies as they arrived from the
agent, so a conversation can be reassembled in order — which is the unit
cross-turn folding works on.

# What it takes and what it drops

The LARGEST inbound body per conversation, because an agent re-sends its whole
history every turn: the last request already contains every earlier message, so
taking every request would be the same text many times over and would flatter
the fold enormously.

Messages keep their order and role. Content blocks are joined; shapes the walker
would not read are dropped rather than guessed at.
